This is a patched version of the original karydia helm chart:
- refactor ssl and webhook configuration logic: remove cumbersome hook, use sprig crypto functions instead; requires helm's lookup function (helm >= 3.2)
- remove custom-seccomp logic; according folder was anyway empty; in addition the daemonset's labels were not unique enough (clashes with the main deployment's selector)
- use kubernetes.io/metadata.name label to exclude kube-system reliably (available from k8s 1.21, resp. earlier as alpha feature gate)
- remove delete hook (not needed anymore)
